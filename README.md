# Wordpress Task 01
This is a challenging but meaningful task to understand a developer's WordPress skills.

If you get stuck somewhere, feel free to ask us. We believe in the power of learning. You don't have to know everything, but you should know how to learn and get help.

## Task
Develop the missing parts of the plugin named "Easy Visual Composer Components (EVCC)" with good writing of code.

We add some codes to scaffold the project but there is no head. You need to add that head to the project and represent the results.

## Required Missions
Please complete following missions.

- [ ] Make the folders inside the shortcodes folder works as regular WordPress shortcodes. Now there is one [evcc_buttons] but the number will be increased soon :)
- [ ] Represent the evcc_buttons shortcode with creating a page contains possible using variations of the shortcode.
- [ ] Make the evcc_buttons shortcode available as a Visual Composer Component.
- [ ] Represent the evcc_buttons Visual Composer component with creating a page contains possible using variations of the component.
- [ ] Create a new shortcode named "Section Header" under the shortcodes folder. It should contains the following parameters: Style, Title, Content, Button.
- [ ] Make the Section Header component has two styles (you can name it) and style those versions. Use your imagination to style it.
- [ ] Represent the Section Header component and its variations with creating a new page.

## Extra Missions
If you are someone who loves challenges you can also complete these missions too and we will add a plus to your score :)

- [ ] Make others plugins (or themes) can use your mechanism to create shortcodes and VC components with WordPress filters which means they only should be create a shortcodes folder contains its shortcodes like ours.
- [ ] Add a plugin settings page under the settings menu for Editor and Administrator level users.
- [ ] Make EVCC_AGENCY value changeable via the settings page.
- [ ] Make the settings page secure and looks cool.
